# Resend-Native Email Automation Deployment

## What This Approach Does

✅ **Uses Resend Audiences** - Automatically adds subscribers to a "Haas on SaaS Subscribers" audience
✅ **Leverages Resend's Infrastructure** - No complex queue management needed
✅ **Simple Scheduling** - Lightweight KV-based scheduling for follow-up emails
✅ **Native Analytics** - Uses Resend's built-in email tracking and tagging

## Architecture

1. **Subscription Flow**:
   - User subscribes → Added to Resend audience
   - Welcome email 1 sent immediately via Resend API
   - Emails 2 & 3 scheduled in Cloudflare KV

2. **Scheduled Processing**:
   - Cron job checks for due emails
   - Sends via Resend API with proper tagging
   - Updates subscriber preferences

## Environment Variables Needed

```
RESEND_API_KEY (already exists)
SUBSCRIBERS (already exists)
EMAIL_SCHEDULE (new KV namespace)
```

## Cloudflare Setup

1. **Create KV Namespace**:
   ```bash
   # In Cloudflare Dashboard or CLI
   wrangler kv:namespace create "EMAIL_SCHEDULE"
   ```

2. **Bind to Pages Project**:
   - Go to Pages → Settings → Functions
   - Add KV binding: `EMAIL_SCHEDULE`

3. **Set up Cron** (optional):
   ```toml
   [triggers]
   crons = ["0 */2 * * *"]  # Every 2 hours
   ```

## Resend Benefits

- **Automatic Unsubscribe Handling**: Resend manages unsubscribes
- **Built-in Analytics**: Track opens, clicks, bounces
- **Email Tagging**: Each email tagged with campaign/type
- **Audience Management**: Centralized subscriber management
- **Reliable Delivery**: Resend's infrastructure handles delivery

## Function URLs

- `/resend-automation/trigger-welcome` - Start welcome series
- `/resend-automation/process-scheduled` - Process scheduled emails

## Manual Testing

```bash
# Trigger welcome series
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/resend-automation/trigger-welcome \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com"}'

# Process scheduled emails manually
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/resend-automation/process-scheduled
```

## Key Improvements Over Custom Queue

1. **Simpler Architecture**: Uses Resend's proven infrastructure
2. **Better Analytics**: Built-in tracking and reporting
3. **Automatic Audience Management**: Centralized subscriber lists
4. **Fewer Moving Parts**: Less custom code to maintain
5. **Professional Features**: Unsubscribe handling, bounce management

## Welcome Series Timeline

- **Email 1**: Immediate (via Resend API)
- **Email 2**: +24 hours (scheduled in KV)  
- **Email 3**: +72 hours (scheduled in KV)

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the new function
2. Set up EMAIL_SCHEDULE KV namespace
3. Test with a real email address
4. Set up cron for scheduled processing
5. Monitor Resend dashboard for analytics

This approach gives you the best of both worlds: Resend's professional email infrastructure with the flexibility to customize timing and content.
