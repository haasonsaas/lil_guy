## Problem Definition & Solvability

- Emphasize the importance of clearly defining the problem the AI aims to solve.
- Explore methods to assess whether the problem is even solvable using AI.
- Discuss the potential for false positives in AI project ideation.

## Technical Feasibility & Resource Requirements

- Outline a basic checklist for evaluating technical feasibility (existing tools, libraries, infrastructure).
- Analyze resource requirements (personnel, computational power, time) and their implications.
- Highlight the potential cost-benefit analysis and the importance of defining realistic expectations.

## Conclusion

- Summarize the key steps involved in the Quick AI Test.
- Offer advice on how to interpret the results and make informed decisions.
- Encourage readers to share their experiences and challenges in the comments.
