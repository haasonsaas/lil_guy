I recently came across a LinkedIn post from Uri, CISO at SiriusXM, that perfectly captured the frustration many security leaders feel: "It's not a security conference, it's a marketing and vendor conference. I don't need an additional 1000 emails telling me to give people 30 min for the ultimate solution to all my security problems."

His sentiment resonated deeply with me, having walked both sides of this divide – first as a security engineer, then as a founder of a security startup, and now working on new security products while still maintaining close ties to the practitioner community.

## The CISO's Burden: Death by 1,000 Sales Pitches

The modern security leader faces a relentless barrage of vendor outreach that borders on harassment. The numbers are staggering:

1. **Overwhelming Volume**: The average enterprise CISO receives 30-50 vendor solicitations _daily_ – that's 7,500-12,500 annually.
1. **Time Vampire**: If a CISO granted just 15% of these requests the standard "30 minutes" being requested, they'd spend 20+ hours weekly – half their working hours – in vendor meetings.
1. **Diminishing Signal-to-Noise**: With over 3,500 security vendors in the market (a number that's doubled in the last five years), identifying truly valuable solutions becomes nearly impossible.
1. **Tactical Disruption**: Each context switch from strategic work to vendor evaluation costs approximately 23 minutes of productivity, according to research on task switching.

One Fortune 500 CISO I spoke with recently tracked their vendor communications for a month and discovered they'd received 1,473 unique vendor emails, 217 LinkedIn messages, and 86 phone calls – all from security vendors claiming to have the "one solution" that would transform their security program.

## The Vendor's Dilemma: Breaking Through the Noise

From the vendor perspective – and I speak from experience as both a builder and seller – the challenges are equally daunting:

1. **Market Saturation**: With thousands of competitors, differentiation becomes extraordinarily difficult.
1. **Access Challenges**: Decision-makers have erected increasingly sophisticated barriers to vendor communication.
1. **Legitimate Value**: Many vendors genuinely believe their solutions address critical problems – and many actually do!
1. **Sales Pressure**: Investor expectations and growth targets create relentless pressure to fill pipelines, driving increasingly aggressive outreach tactics.

This creates what I call the "Security Vendor Paradox" – vendors must reach CISOs to survive, yet the collective volume of these attempts makes CISOs increasingly unreachable.

## How We Got Here: The Broken Ecosystem

Our current dysfunction didn't emerge overnight. Several factors have created this perfect storm:

### 1. The Security Funding Frenzy

Venture capital has flooded into cybersecurity at unprecedented rates. From 2020 to 2024, more than $70 billion in venture funding poured into security startups. While this capital influx has driven innovation, it's also:

- Created thousands of point solutions addressing increasingly narrow problems
- Generated pressure for aggressive growth metrics regardless of market fit
- Rewarded sales-driven cultures over sustainable value creation
- Shortened the timeline between funding and expected ROI

The result? Armies of SDRs instructed to "book meetings at all costs" with little understanding of the actual security landscape or the CISO's real challenges.

### 2. The Weaponization of Fear

Security marketing has increasingly relied on fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) to drive engagement:

- Sensationalizing threats beyond their actual risk profiles
- Creating artificial urgency around emerging vulnerabilities
- Promising comprehensive protection against "inevitable" breaches
- Exploiting compliance requirements and regulatory changes

When every vendor claims their solution prevents the next catastrophic breach, security leaders become justifiably skeptical of all claims.

### 3. The Metrics Mismatch

Vendors and CISOs operate with fundamentally misaligned success metrics:

**Vendor Success Metrics:**

- Meetings booked
- Pipeline generated
- Deals closed
- YoY growth

**CISO Success Metrics:**

- Risk reduced
- Program maturity increased
- Incidents prevented
- Operational efficiency

This disconnect creates fundamentally different priorities and incentives, often putting vendors and practitioners at cross-purposes.

### 4. The Consolidation Conundrum

The security industry faces a persistent tension between platform consolidation and best-of-breed solutions:

- **The Platform Promise**: "Use our comprehensive suite and reduce vendor sprawl!"
- **The Specialist Claim**: "Our focused solution outperforms the comparable module in any platform!"

CISOs are caught in an endless cycle of consolidating vendors, becoming dissatisfied with platform limitations, adopting point solutions, then struggling with integration challenges, and returning to consolidation.

## From Both Sides Now: My Dual Perspective

Having stood on both sides of this divide, I've gained some uncomfortable insights:

### What Vendors Misunderstand About CISOs:

1. **The Scale of the Problem**: Most vendors fail to recognize they're not competing against a few rivals for attention – they're competing against hundreds or thousands of similar messages.
1. **The Trust Deficit**: Every misleading claim, exaggerated capability, or high-pressure tactic doesn't just lose that sale – it damages the entire vendor ecosystem's credibility.
1. **Value Demonstration Timing**: CISOs need evidence of value before, not during, that precious 30-minute meeting.
1. **The Solution Integration Reality**: No solution exists in isolation. Every new tool creates integration work, training requirements, and maintenance overhead.

### What CISOs Often Miss About Vendors:

1. **The Signal Within Noise**: Sometimes that persistent vendor genuinely has identified a critical gap in your security architecture.
1. **The Innovation Dilemma**: Early-stage companies with transformative approaches struggle most to get attention, while established vendors with incremental improvements have easier access.
1. **The Expertise Resource**: Many vendors employ genuine experts whose knowledge could benefit your program, even if you never buy their product.
1. **The Economics of Sales**: The current dysfunction is often driven by systemic factors rather than individual bad actors.

## A Better Way Forward

So how do we break this cycle? Based on my experience on both sides, here are concrete changes that could transform this dysfunctional ecosystem:

### For Vendors:

1. **Embrace Qualification**: Stop pursuing meetings with everyone with "security" in their title. Develop genuine qualification criteria beyond company size and industry.
1. **Demonstrate Value Upfront**: Create educational content, open-source tools, or assessment frameworks that provide value before asking for time.
1. **Respect the No**: Develop sophisticated outbound processes that acknowledge and respect when a prospect isn't interested.
1. **Authenticity at Scale**: Train sales teams to understand security challenges deeply enough to have meaningful conversations.
1. **Collaborative Selling**: Build relationships with complementary vendors to present integrated solutions rather than isolated products.

Several vendors are already pioneering this approach with promising results. One security startup I advise abandoned traditional SDR outreach entirely, instead creating an open-source scanning tool that provides immediate value. Their inbound pipeline now exceeds what their outbound efforts ever produced.

### For CISOs:

1. **Create Structured Intake**: Establish clear processes for vendor evaluation with published criteria and timelines.
1. **Delegate Appropriately**: Develop a team approach to vendor assessment with clear roles for initial screening.
1. **Provide Constructive Feedback**: When rejecting vendors, explain why – this educates the ecosystem.
1. **Be Intentionally Accessible**: Create specific channels or times for engaging with truly innovative approaches.
1. **Partner with Procurement**: Develop security-specific vendor management processes that streamline evaluation.

A healthcare CISO I worked with implemented quarterly "pitch days" where pre-screened vendors could present to their entire security team. This approach reduced ad-hoc meeting requests by 64% while actually increasing their discovery of valuable solutions.

### For the Ecosystem:

1. **Collaborative Evaluation Frameworks**: Industry organizations could develop standardized evaluation processes and shared assessment results.
1. **Reputation Systems**: Create feedback mechanisms that reward valuable vendor interactions and penalize abusive tactics.
1. **Centralized Discovery Platforms**: Support curator-driven marketplaces that match solutions to specific organizational needs.
1. **Investor Education**: Venture capital firms need to develop more sophisticated metrics beyond "meetings booked" for evaluating early-stage security companies.

## The Uncomfortably Personal Conclusion

I'll conclude with a confession: I've been part of the problem. As a founder desperate to get my security solution in front of decision-makers, I authorized outreach tactics that I now recognize contributed to the very dysfunction I'm criticizing. The pressure to grow, to meet investor expectations, to outperform competitors – these forces can push even well-intentioned leaders toward behaviors that damage the ecosystem.

But I've also experienced the frustration from the other side. As a security engineer, I spent countless hours evaluating solutions that never delivered on their promises. I've felt the resentment toward vendors who wasted my time with capabilities that existed only in PowerPoint. I've seen the damage done when security teams invest in products that fail to deliver operational value.

The hard truth is this: Our industry has created an adversarial relationship between vendors and practitioners that serves neither group effectively. Vendors struggle to reach qualified prospects. CISOs miss potentially valuable solutions. And ultimately, organizations remain more vulnerable than they should be because the matching of problems to solutions has become so inefficient.

We can do better. We must do better. The stakes – the security of our digital infrastructure – are too high to accept the status quo.

So next time you're tempted to send that follow-up to a CISO who hasn't responded to your last three messages, or when you're about to delete every vendor email without reading them – pause and consider how we might break this cycle together.

The security challenges we face require innovation, collaboration, and trust. None of these flourish in our current environment. It's time for change, and that change begins with both sides recognizing their role in creating a healthier ecosystem.
