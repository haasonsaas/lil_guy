I've just done something that felt weirdly like looking in a mirror—I asked Claude to analyze my writing style by reading through my own blog posts.

**The result? A 363-line addition to my CLAUDE.md file that captures how I write, why I write that way, and what patterns I unconsciously follow.**

This post you're reading right now? It's the test case.

## The Experiment

Here's what happened: I asked Claude to examine "deeply a number of the blog posts to determine how I write." No specific instructions. No examples of what to look for. Just pure pattern recognition.

Claude read through posts about technical debt, SaaS metrics, pricing psychology, A/B testing, and developer experiences. Then it produced a comprehensive style guide that made me realize things about my own writing I'd never consciously noticed.

## What Claude Found (That I Didn't Know I Did)

The analysis revealed patterns I'd been following without thinking:

**Structural Patterns:**
- I apparently love starting with personal anecdotes or bold claims
- My paragraphs rarely exceed 2-4 sentences
- I use rhetorical questions as section transitions
- Strategic fragments. For emphasis.

**Voice Characteristics:**
- Direct address ("you") throughout
- Present tense for immediacy
- Contractions everywhere (because who says "do not" in conversation?)
- Zero hedge words—no "maybe" or "perhaps" cluttering the message

**The Formula I Didn't Know I Had:**
1. Hook with controversy or experience
2. Identify the problem
3. Promise value upfront
4. Build tension between conventional wisdom and reality

Sound familiar? You're reading it right now.

## The Meta Twist

What's fascinating is watching Claude apply these patterns in real-time. This post follows the extracted guidelines:
- Started with a personal anecdote ✓
- Short paragraphs ✓
- Direct address to "you" ✓
- Concrete examples ✓
- No unnecessary preamble ✓

But here's where it gets interesting: Claude also identified what I *don't* do:
- No academic paragraphs
- No passive voice (unless absolutely necessary)
- No over-explaining simple concepts
- No unnecessary apologies

## The Practical Value

Why does this matter? Three reasons:

1. **Consistency at scale**: When you're creating content regularly, maintaining a consistent voice is hard. Having your patterns documented helps.

2. **Delegation without dilution**: Whether working with AI or human writers, you can share these guidelines to maintain your voice.

3. **Self-awareness**: Understanding your own patterns helps you break them when necessary—or lean into them when they work.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

There's something unsettling about having your writing patterns laid bare. It's like hearing your recorded voice for the first time. 

Claude identified my "slightly irreverent" tone and tendency to "challenge conventional wisdom." Guilty as charged. It found my love of science metaphors and concrete scenarios. It even caught my pattern of ending sections with clear action steps.

But it also revealed the method behind what felt like instinct.

## What This Means for AI-Assisted Writing

We're entering an era where AI doesn't just write *for* us—it can write *as* us. Not in a creepy, identity-theft way, but as a tool that understands and amplifies our unique voice.

The key isn't teaching AI to write better. It's teaching it to write like *you* write.

## Your Turn

Want to try this experiment yourself? Here's the prompt that started it all:

"Can you examine deeply a number of the blog posts to determine how I write, and update your claude.md with instructions to write in that style?"

Fair warning: You might learn things about your writing you didn't know. You might discover patterns you want to keep—or ones you want to break.

But that's the point. Self-awareness is the first step to intentional improvement.

*What patterns would AI find in your writing? I'd love to hear what you discover.*
