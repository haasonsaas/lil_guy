The FTC just dropped a 44-page complaint against Uber, alleging deceptive practices around its *Uber One* subscription. If you're a product manager, it's tempting to treat this kind of legal drama as someone else’s problem. It’s not.

Behind the legalese lies a brutally honest product teardown—one that offers invaluable lessons on user experience, growth strategy, and what happens when product design loses sight of trust.

Let’s break it down—and more importantly, zoom out to what PMs should take away from it.

## The Basics: What Uber Allegedly Did

Uber, according to the FTC, enrolled users into its $9.99/month *Uber One* subscription without proper consent. Many users reportedly:

- Didn’t know they signed up.
- Had no idea they were being charged.
- Struggled to cancel—requiring up to 32 steps across 23 screens.

Despite advertising “cancel anytime,” the experience was engineered to frustrate.

In other words: dark patterns, weaponized at scale.

## Growth At What Cost?

Every PM has felt the pressure: increase conversion. Reduce churn. Hit your quarterly KPIs.

But this case is a case study in the **long-term cost of short-term optimization**.

Uber reportedly added friction to the cancellation process to reduce churn—something that might look great on a dashboard. But here’s the trade:

- 🎯 **Short-term win:** Lower churn metrics.
- 💣 **Long-term cost:** Brand erosion, regulatory action, lawsuits, and executive time spent dealing with PR disasters.

If your growth comes at the expense of user trust, it’s not sustainable. It’s a ticking clock.

## What This Teaches Product Managers

Here are the deeper lessons that go beyond “don’t make it hard to cancel”:

### 1. **Consent Is More Than a Checkbox**

Uber often enrolled users with subtle nudges—checkmarks, default options, and “Try for Free” buttons that triggered full enrollment without explicit understanding. As a PM, you must ask:

> ❓ Does the user *truly understand* what they’re agreeing to?

If your product depends on users skimming, guessing, or getting tricked—you’re doing it wrong.

### 2. **Friction Isn’t Neutral**

Not all friction is bad. Good friction can guide users toward clarity, prevent errors, or improve data quality.

But when friction is *deliberately engineered* to confuse or delay action (like making cancellation absurdly hard), you’re now in “dark pattern” territory—and that’s not just unethical, it’s legally risky.

Design questions to ask:
- Are we adding steps to *inform* or to *deter*?
- Does this friction serve the user’s interest—or only ours?

### 3. **“Legal” Doesn’t Mean “Right”**

It’s tempting to lean on legal approval as the final filter. “If legal signed off, we’re good.”

But this case shows how product decisions can **pass legal review and still get sued**.

Ethical product development needs a higher standard:
- Would I feel good explaining this design to a user?
- Would I be okay if this screenshot ended up in a court filing?

### 4. **Your Metrics Might Be Lying to You**

Here’s the kicker: Uber’s product team may have celebrated reduced churn and increased conversions without realizing the real story.

If a customer stays subscribed because they can’t figure out how to leave, that’s not retention—it’s *coercion*.

Good metrics don’t just measure what happened—they help us understand *why* it happened.

## Real Talk: Designing Ethical Subscriptions

Let’s say you’re a PM on a freemium product with a paid tier. You’re under pressure to hit MRR targets. How do you stay out of the Uber trap?

Here’s what ethical, sustainable subscription UX looks like:

### ✅ Transparent Enrollment

- Make price, billing frequency, and renewal timing *obvious*.
- Use clear CTAs: “Start $9.99/mo Subscription” > “Try Now”.

### ✅ Legit Free Trials

- Tell users *exactly* when they’ll be charged.
- Send reminder emails *before* charging them.

### ✅ Easy, Respectful Cancellation

- One path. Few steps.
- No guilt. No scavenger hunts.
- Bonus points for: “Pause subscription” options for seasonal churn.

## A New KPI: Customer Dignity

Let’s talk about something rarely in the dashboard: **customer dignity**.

- Can users control their experience?
- Do they feel respected, even when leaving?
- Do we make it easy for them to understand what’s happening?

It’s time to build that into how we measure product quality.

We’re not just designing flows. We’re designing *relationships*.

## What You Can Do Today

🧭 Whether you work on payments, onboarding, or growth—take 15 minutes and do this:

1. **Try to cancel your own product.**
   - How many steps does it take?
   - How obvious is the path?

2. **Map every “Yes” moment.**
   - Are users making informed decisions—or just clicking through?

3. **Review your metrics with ethics in mind.**
   - Is success coming from value—or confusion?

## Final Thought

Uber’s FTC case is a wake-up call—not just for lawyers and execs, but for product teams everywhere.

**We are responsible** for the systems we design. That includes the parts users don’t love. That includes the metrics we celebrate. That includes the choices we nudge them toward.

You don’t need a scandal to course-correct. You just need to care.

And if we can’t say our product respects the people who use it—what are we even building?
