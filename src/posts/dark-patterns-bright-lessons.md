The FTC just dropped a 44-page complaint against Uber for deceptive practices around its Uber One subscription. You might think: _legal drama, not my lane._

But here's the truth: this isn't just a lawsuit. It's a product teardown—one that exposes what happens when growth strategy is prioritized over user trust.

If you're a PM, treat this like a red-team exercise for your own work. Because the line between "high-converting" and "manipulative" is thinner than you think.

## The Allegations: Design Weaponized

According to the FTC, Uber:

- Enrolled users into Uber One without proper consent
- Buried disclosures behind vague copy and subtle UI nudges
- Charged users without them realizing it
- Made cancellation take up to **32 steps across 23 screens**
- Advertised "cancel anytime" while designing flows to prevent it

Translation: dark patterns, operationalized at scale.

This wasn't a bug. It was the business model.

## The Real Cost of "Optimizing"

Sure, churn likely dropped. KPIs probably looked great.

But here's what else happened:

- 🚨 Class-action lawsuits
- 📉 Erosion of brand trust
- 👀 Federal regulators crawling through their product flows
- ⏳ Countless exec hours spent on PR damage control

**Growth that erodes trust isn't growth. It's debt.** And that debt always comes due.

## What You Should Take Away as a PM

This case isn't just about cancel buttons. It's about how product decisions—made under the guise of optimization—can metastasize into systemic abuse.

### 1. **Consent Is Not a Checkbox**

If your product relies on users skimming, misreading, or giving up—you're not designing an experience, you're running a con.

> **Ask yourself:** Would a reasonable user _clearly understand_ what they're opting into?

If not, it's not consent. It's manipulation.

### 2. **Friction Is Not Neutral**

Not all friction is bad. Some clarifies. Some protects. But friction that exists _only_ to trap users or delay action?

That's not design. That's entrapment.

> **Ask:** Does this friction serve _the user's_ interest—or only ours?

### 3. **Legal Isn't the Bar—It's the Floor**

"It passed legal" isn't a defense. The FTC's complaint proves that legal sign-off won't save you from a headline.

> **Ask:** Would I be proud to walk a user through this flow, step by step?

If not, don't ship it.

### 4. **Your Metrics Might Be Lying to You**

Retention isn't real if it's coerced. Growth isn't real if it comes from confusion.

> **Ask:** Are people staying because they love us—or because they can't figure out how to leave?

Interrogate your metrics, not just your roadmap.

## A Litmus Test: Try Canceling Your Own Product

Take 15 minutes. Try to cancel your product's subscription as if you were a frustrated user. No shortcuts. No internal tools.

- How many steps does it take?
- Is the path obvious?
- Is the language clear or evasive?
- Are there guilt trips, roadblocks, or dead ends?

If you're embarrassed by what you find—you already have your roadmap.

## What Ethical Subscription UX Looks Like

Here's a baseline for sustainable, defensible subscription design:

### ✅ Transparent Enrollment

- Clear pricing, billing frequency, and renewal details up front
- CTA buttons that _mean what they say_ ("Start $9.99/mo" > "Try Now")

### ✅ Real Free Trials

- Tell users _exactly_ when they'll be charged
- Send reminders before billing

### ✅ Easy, Respectful Cancellation

- One path. Few steps. No scavenger hunts.
- Bonus: offer pause options for seasonal churn

> **If you need 23 screens to prevent churn, your product isn't sticky—it's hostile.**

## The KPI That's Missing: Customer Dignity

Start tracking it:

- Can users control their experience?
- Do they feel respected, even when leaving?
- Are they making informed decisions—or clicking out of fatigue?

You're not just designing flows. You're designing **relationships**.

## Final Thought

The Uber case is a wake-up call.

The systems we design _are our responsibility_. That includes the nudges, the defaults, the offboarding flow, and the metrics we choose to celebrate.

You don't need an FTC lawsuit to fix it.

You just need to care.
