In the decidedly fast-paced world of product management, even breakfast needs a
framework. After extensive user research (asking my colleagues on Slack),
multiple iteration cycles (trying not to spill coffee during stand-ups), and
rigorous A/B testing (oatmeal vs. cereal), I'm excited to present the definitive
guide to The Perfect Product Manager Breakfastâ„¢.

## The Optimal Consumption Window

Through careful analysis of calendar conflicts and meeting schedules, we've
identified the ideal breakfast consumption window: 6:45 AM - 7:15 AM. This time
slot has been specifically chosen to maximize nutrient intake while minimizing
calendar conflicts with APAC and EMEA teams.

_Note: This window is subject to change based on conflicting calendar invites,
unexpected Slack messages, and that one stakeholder who always schedules
meetings at breakfast time._

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Every good product needs metrics, and breakfast is no exception. Here are the
critical KPIs for measuring breakfast success:

1. Protein-to-Meeting Ratio (PMR): Maintain a minimum of 12g protein per
   scheduled sync
1. Time-to-First-Slack: Should not exceed 2 minutes (we're professionals here)
1. Breakfast Net Promoter Score: Target is 8+ (as measured by your energy levels
   in your first morning meeting)

## Coffee Requirements Specification

Coffee intake should follow an agile methodology, with continuous deployment
throughout the morning. Initial MVP (Minimum Viable Pour) should begin at first
wake-up call, with subsequent iterations every 30-45 minutes.

Current Sprint Coffee Count: 1 (Use increment button as needed)

## The Meeting Paradox

As any seasoned PM knows, meetings follow the law of inverse productivity: the
more important your breakfast, the more likely you are to have conflicting
meetings. Our current data shows:

Current Morning Meeting Count: 3 (Numbers only go up)

## Success Metrics

As the ancient product management proverb states: "A successful breakfast should
be measured not by the calories consumed, but by the number of Slack messages
sent while eating."

## Key Success Factors:

- Multi-tasking capability (minimum 3 simultaneous activities)
- One-handed eating proficiency
- Strategic mute button usage during chewing
- Slack response time < 30 seconds (even with mouth full)

## Conclusion

Remember, this is merely a template and should be customized based on your
specific use cases and organizational breakfast culture. All metrics are subject
to change pending stakeholder feedback and quarterly OKR review.

_Disclaimer: This template has been approved by 9 out of 10 stakeholders in a
recent sync. The tenth stakeholder had to leave early to grab coffee._
