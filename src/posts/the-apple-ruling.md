# The Apple Ruling: A Win That Might Hurt More Than Help

The DOJ vs. Apple ruling is being hailed as a major win for developers. You’ve probably seen the headlines: “Apple must allow third‑party payment systems!” “Developers can finally avoid the 15–30% cut!”

But let’s slow down for a second. Because what looks like a win on paper might end up being a trap in practice.

## The Numbers Everyone Ignores

Yes, Apple’s 15–30% fee is steep. But here’s the quiet tradeoff most folks gloss over:

> When you send users *off‑platform* to complete a purchase, you *will* see your conversion rate nosedive.

And I don’t mean a 5% drop. I’m talking about **15–30% (or worse)** in lost revenue simply because of friction.

You know this intuitively:

- You’re watching a streaming app.  
- A subscription screen pops up.  
- You tap “subscribe.”  
- Instead of a fingerprint and Face ID, you get booted to a janky mobile browser.  
- You squint through a poorly optimized form, dig up your credit card, and pray it doesn’t time out.

**How many people bail at that moment?** A lot.

## Why In‑App Checkout Wins

Apple didn’t invent conversion psychology. But they sure did weaponize it.

The native in‑app purchase (IAP) flow is fast, seamless, and—crucially—trusted. Apple built an experience that:

- Doesn’t ask you to re‑enter info  
- Doesn’t trigger security fears  
- Doesn’t feel like a leap of faith  

Compare that to the average web‑based payment page, and you start to realize: that 30% fee might’ve been buying you more than just a transaction—it was buying frictionless trust.

## Developers Are Underestimating Dropoff

Let’s get real: most app developers aren’t optimizing checkout flows for mobile. They don’t have Apple’s design muscle. They don’t A/B test like Amazon. They just want to get paid.

So here’s what’s about to happen:

1. Devs rush to implement third‑party payments to dodge Apple’s fee  
2. Revenue drops 20–40% due to poor UX and trust erosion  
3. Users complain about confusing purchase flows  
4. Devs come crawling back to Apple’s IAP—with a little less swagger  

This won’t be everyone, of course. Big brands with optimized flows and loyal users will navigate this fine. But for indie developers and mid‑sized apps, this is going to sting.

## What Happens Next?

Here’s the most likely future:

- **Big developers** (think Spotify, Epic) will roll their own payment flows and market the hell out of them.  
- **Smaller developers** will experiment, get burned, and stick with IAP.  
- **Apple** will quietly let developers make the switch, knowing many will come back.

In other words, this is a win... until you read the fine print.

## The Bigger Question: What Business Are You In?

If your business is payments? Sure—owning the checkout flow is strategic.

If your business is *not* payments? Then maybe letting Apple handle that part wasn’t such a bad deal.

We talk a lot about margins. But what’s the margin on a conversion that doesn’t happen?

## Closing Thought: Just Because You *Can* Doesn’t Mean You *Should*

This ruling opens a door. But what’s behind it might not be a better business model—it might just be more complexity and less revenue.

For most devs, the real takeaway isn’t “ditch Apple’s fees.” It’s:

> **“Be careful what you optimize for.”**

You might win the argument and still lose the sale.
