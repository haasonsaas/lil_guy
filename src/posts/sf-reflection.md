It's been exactly three months since I returned to San Francisco, and I'm finally starting to feel like I'm settling into a
new rhythm. The journey from founder working 20-hour days to product manager
prioritizing both career growth and personal health has been more
challenging—and more rewarding—than I anticipated.

## The Paperwork Never Ends

They don't tell you this when you're in the throes of startup passion: closing a
company takes almost as much paperwork as starting one. Six months after
officially winding down ThreatKey's operations, I'm still dealing with
unexpected trailing administrative tasks. Random emails from former vendors. Tax
documents requiring signatures. Insurance matters needing resolution. The final
legal bits that refuse to disappear.

After pouring four years of my life into building something from nothing,
there's something both frustrating and poignant about these lingering tasks.
Each form I sign feels like saying goodbye to a different part of that chapter.
I find myself simultaneously wanting to close this loop completely and wanting
to hold onto these last tangible connections to what we built.

## From Founder to PM: A Professional Identity Shift

Transitioning from founder to product manager has been an exercise in
recalibrating my professional identity. As a founder, every decision was
ultimately mine—for better or worse. The buck stopped with me. The weight of
that responsibility was both exhausting and oddly addictive.

Now, six months into my new PM role, I'm learning to channel my entrepreneurial
energy within different constraints. I'm part of a team with established
processes. I need to influence rather than direct. I need to collaborate in ways
that are more structured than the freewheeling startup days.

What's surprised me most is how much I'm enjoying this shift. Without the
existential pressure of keeping a company alive, I can be more thoughtful about
product decisions. I can learn from colleagues with diverse experiences. I can
focus on building excellence in one area rather than being spread impossibly
thin across every function.

## The 100lb Journey: Reclaiming My Health

Perhaps the most visible change in my life isn't the career shift but the
physical transformation. After four years of 20-hour workdays fueled by pizza
and energy drinks, I've lost 100 pounds since starting my health journey six
months ago.

The decision came from a place of painful clarity: I had sacrificed my health on
the altar of entrepreneurship, believing that physical wellbeing was a luxury I
couldn't afford while building ThreatKey. I convinced myself that extreme work
patterns were necessary for success. I was wrong.

The weight loss journey began during our wind-down phase and accelerated after.
Without the constant stress of founder life, I could focus on establishing
sustainable habits:

- Regular sleep schedules instead of coding or outbounding until 4 AM
- Meal preparation (though I should note that my girlfriend is the one who
  actually meal preps - I'm at best a taste tester)
- Daily movement instead of being chained to my desk
- Meditation instead of anxiety-scrolling through metrics

The irony isn't lost on me that I'm now more productive, creative, and effective
working reasonable hours with a healthy body than I ever was working around the
clock in a depleted state.

## The Healthy Grind: Finding Sustainable Intensity

I haven't abandoned ambition or the willingness to work hard. I've just
redefined what "the grind" means to me. The healthy grind isn't about maximum
hours—it's about maximum impact within sustainable boundaries.

Some days still require intense focus and extended hours. The difference is
they're now the exception rather than the rule. I've learned to sprint when
necessary, but I no longer treat life like an endless ultramarathon.

What's been most revealing is discovering that many of those 20-hour days
weren't actually producing 20 hours of valuable output. They were producing
maybe 8-10 hours of good work surrounded by exhausted, diminishing-returns
effort that I convinced myself was necessary.

## Lessons from Four Years of Founder Life

Looking back at the ThreatKey journey from my current vantage point, I can see
both what I'd do differently and what I'm grateful for experiencing:

- **The relationships matter most.** The investors who believed in us, the
  customers who trusted us, the team members who joined our mission—these
  connections outlast the company itself.

- **Sustainable pace wins.** Had I maintained better balance throughout, would
  we have made better strategic decisions? I'll never know, but I suspect yes.

- **San Francisco's ecosystem is unique.** Being back in SF after trying to
  build remotely during parts of our journey, I'm reminded how much the city's
  concentration of talent, capital, and innovation matters.

## Coming Full Circle in the City by the Bay

The past three months in San Francisco have felt like a true homecoming. This
city watched me launch ThreatKey with boundless optimism, navigate the ups and
downs that followed, and now, it's seeing me embrace a more balanced approach as
I grow.

The hills I once climbed while dictating urgent emails into my phone, I now
climb as part of my morning routine, present in the moment, appreciating the fog
rolling over the Golden Gate.

The coffee shops where I once frantically pitched investors are now places where
I can sit and thoughtfully map out product strategies or simply enjoy a moment
of pause.

San Francisco has always been a city of reinvention, and I'm grateful to be
writing this new chapter here—100 pounds lighter, professionally renewed, and
finally understanding that sustainable growth ultimately takes us further than
unsustainable hustle.
