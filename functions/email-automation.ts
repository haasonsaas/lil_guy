Hey there,

Thanks for subscribing! I'm Jonathan, and I write about the reality of building and scaling SaaS companies â€” the stuff they don't teach you in the startup playbooks.

After a decade building enterprise software (from security tools to vertical SaaS), I've learned that success comes down to three things:

â€¢ Technical vision that actually solves real problems
â€¢ Market reality that cuts through the hype  
â€¢ Execution discipline that bridges the gap between them

Every Tuesday, I send one tactical insight that helps founders and builders navigate this complexity. No fluff, all signal.

Read recent posts: https://haasonsaas.com/blog

Over the next few days, I'll share some of my favorite posts to get you started. But for now, here's what you can expect:

â€¢ Real stories from the trenches of SaaS building
â€¢ Tactical advice on AI, product strategy, and team dynamics
â€¢ Honest takes on what actually works (and what doesn't)

Looking forward to having you along for the ride.

Best,
Jonathan

Tomorrow, I'll share my take on what's actually happening in tech right now â€” beyond the hype cycles and conference talks.

Talk soon,

Final email in this welcome series (don't worry, I'll be back with regular content soon).

I want to share my take on where we are right now â€” because I think it's one of the most interesting times to be building software.

The AI Revolution is Real, But Not How You Think

Everyone's talking about AI replacing developers or creating magical user experiences. The reality? AI is becoming plumbing. The companies that win will be those that use AI to solve real problems, not those that build AI for AI's sake.

Here's what I'm seeing after 10 years in enterprise software:

â€¢ Technical complexity is increasing â€” Modern SaaS stacks are more sophisticated than ever
â€¢ User expectations are rising â€” B2B software that feels like consumer apps isn't optional anymore  
â€¢ Market dynamics are shifting â€” Vertical SaaS is eating horizontal tools, AI is commoditizing features

But here's the opportunity: while everyone else is chasing the latest framework or AI trend, there's massive value in understanding what actually matters:

â€¢ Building for specific, painful problems
â€¢ Creating sustainable competitive advantages
â€¢ Balancing technical innovation with business reality

That's exactly what I write about every week.

Not the hype, not the hot takes, but the messy, complex reality of building things that people actually want to use and pay for.

Thanks for subscribing, and welcome to the community. You'll hear from me every Tuesday with tactical insights, honest perspectives, and real stories from the trenches.
